# FXOSChassisOrchestrator

Tool designed to speed up the FXOS configuration process. Long term goal is to have it automatically push the config to the device(s) to allow for zero-touch deployments.

Currently configures commonly set platform settings, interfaces, port-channels and logical devices in standalone mode.

Simply configure the spreadsheet and let it rip. Note: Column A values have to match or the script will not parse correctly.

Add additional tabs for additional configs to be generated, there is no limit.

Thanks and enjoy.
