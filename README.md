# FXOSChassisOrchestrator

Tool designed to speed up the FXOS configuration process. Long term goal is to have it automatically push the config to the device(s) to allow for zero-touch deployments.

Currently configures commonly set platform settings, interfaces and port-channels.

Will be adding the ability to provision the logical devices as well as some code cleanup too.
