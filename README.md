# FXOSChassisOrchestrator

Tool designed to speed up the FXOS configuration process. Long term goal is to have it automatically push the config to the device(s) to allow for zero-touch deployments.

Currently configures commonly set platform settings, interfaces, port-channels and logical devices in standalone mode.
